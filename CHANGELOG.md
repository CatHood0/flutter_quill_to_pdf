**Â¡BREAKING CHANGES!**

The way of build the PDF's it's different and better 

### Before implementation (using `vsc_quill_delta_to_html` and `html2md` with `RegExp` patterns)

The `PDF` is builded: first the `Delta` is converted to a custom implementation, then, after it will be transformed to a `Markdown` with some `HTML` styles to avoid losing align attrs or colors. 

On the creation of the `PDF` (using `PdfService`) all of this `HTML` with `Markdown` are detected using `RegExp` that made more difficult had a correct performance. Some devices even could crash on the building of that `PDF` way.

### New implementation (using `flutter_quill_delta_easy_parser`)

Transform directly a `Delta` to a `Structured-Document` type that it's more easy to be readed by a human, and getting the attributes from any `Line` or the block attributes from the current `Paragraph`.

### Other Changes

* Fix: app crashed when use `createDocument` method.
* Fix: bad perfomance while building a PDF.
* Chore: deprecated `customConverters` param from `PDFConverter` to avoid using after this release
* Fix: removed most of the `RegExp` used on Constant class.
* Fix: removed `MarkdownRules` class since is not necessary now.
* Fix: removed `vsc_quill_delta_to_html` and `html2md` since are not used now.
* Fix: removed `HTMLConverterOptions` local implementation since is not used now.
* Chore: removed `setCustomRules` method from Converter 
* Chore: moved some const values to example since wont be necessary be in the package.

**By now this version is not using CustomPDFWidget or PdfWidgetGenerator. This is just a temporary issue that will be fixed on next releases**
